 <li>To get full credit, <em>you must write down sufficient intermediate steps</em>, only giving the final answer earns you no credit!</li>

 <li>Please make sure that your handwriting is recognizable, otherwise you only get partial credit for the recognizable part.</li>

</ul>

<ol start="2">

 <li>Convert the decimal integer 477 to a normalized FPNwith <em>β </em>= 2.</li>

 <li>Convert the decimal fraction 3/5 to a normalizedFPN with <em>β </em>= 2.</li>

</ol>

<ul>

 <li>Let <em>x </em>= <em>β<sup>e</sup></em>, <em>e </em>∈ Z, <em>L &lt; e &lt; U </em>be a normalized FPN in F and <em>x<sub>L</sub>,x<sub>R </sub></em>∈ F the two normalized FPNs adjacent to <em>x </em>such that <em>x<sub>L </sub>&lt; x &lt; x<sub>R</sub></em>. Prove <em>x<sub>R </sub></em>− <em>x </em>= <em>β</em>(<em>x </em>− <em>x<sub>L</sub></em>).</li>

</ul>

<ol>

 <li>By reusing your result of II, find out the two nor-malized FPNs adjacent to <em>x </em>= 3<em>/</em>5 under the IEEE 754 single-precision protocol. What is fl(<em>x</em>) and the relative roundoff error?</li>

 <li>If the IEEE 754 single-precision protocol did notround off numbers to the nearest, but simply dropped excess bits, what would the unit roundoff be?</li>

 <li>How many bits of precision are lost in the subtraction</li>

1 − cos<em>x </em>when?

<ul>

 <li>Suggest at least two ways to compute 1 − cos<em>x </em>to avoid catastrophic cancellation caused by subtraction.</li>

</ul>

The above eight questions weigh 3, 4, 7, 6, 3, 3, 4 points, respectively, totaling 30 points.

<h1>1           C++ programming</h1>

<ul>

 <li>(10 points) By programming in C++, print values of the functions in (1) at 101 equally spaced points covering the interval [0<em>.</em>99<em>,</em>1<em>.</em>01]. Calculate each function in a straightforward way without rearranging or factoring. Note that the three functions are theoretically the same, but the computed values might be very different. Plot these functions near 1<em>.</em>0 using a magnified scale for the function values to see the variations involved. Discuss what you see. Which one is the most accurate? Why?</li>

 <li>(10 points) Consider a normalized FPN system F with the characterization <em>β </em>= 2<em>,p </em>= 3<em>,L </em>= −1<em>,U </em>= +1. Answer the following by <em>programming </em>in C


  <ul>

   <li>compute UFL(F) and OFL(F) and output them as decimal numbers;</li>

   <li>enumerate all numbers in F and verify the corollary on the cardinality of F in the summary handout;</li>

   <li>plot F on the real axis; • enumerate all the subnormal numbers of F;</li>

   <li>plot the <em>extended </em>F on the real axis.</li>

  </ul></li>
